<h1>Raidr Mods</h1>
            <hr>

    <p>This website is created with the intention of selling modifications (mods)
        to gamers - the target audience for this site. Mods are downloadable modifications for your game that would 
        traditionally be free. (Example: Texture replacement of a character's shirt.)
    
        The goal for this website is to implement a system were mod creators can make
        a profit, but must conform to a contract that requires a deadline and a bug-free 
        product. Currently, B2C will not be willing to make a purchase because 
        selling mods has been frowned upon for a long duration of time. There should be a 
        video within the Home-Page explaining how this benefits the consumer. <br>

        Many consumers within the gaming community can be disdainful with
            regards to paid mods - and the market for paid mods is <br>
            still relatively fresh. But the market is also lacking in terms of variety and quality.
            This is where I hope to shift perceptions, <br>
            and offer a service to consumers that is different and more accomodating to user needs. 
            My product, my webiste, will give consumers a reason to pay for mods, by offering a service 
            that aims to always be reliable, consumer-focused and valuable. But is also appeals to modders, the 
            creators of mods, who scarcely have many means of making profit for their content. Thus, I appeal to
            both the consumer wanting to purchase a reliable, high-quality mod, and also the creator,
            who desires to earn something for all their hard work.<br><br>

        <br><br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<br><br>

        <!--May add Sign-Up modal-->

    <h3><strong>Home Page</strong></h3>
        <p>The homepage is simple.
            
            
                It is paramount for the site's structure and design to be appropriate 
                to the audience. <br> It is unnecessary to overload my users with information or 
                superfluous content - consumers come to site of purchasing a product, a mod, <br>
                and they would want to buy that quick and effeciently so that they can back to gaming.
                Therefore, I have opted for a linear design, which is <br> simple and easy to understand;
                suitable for users of all levels. <br>


            This simple user interface, encourages users to draw their 
            attention to the promotional video on the homepage, <br> which is there 
            to reconcile the quarrelsome relationship between some 
            consumers and paid mods. <br><br>
            
            The promotional offers in front of the hero image fulfills a 
            similar purpose. <br> 
            It helps to reinforce the purpose of the 
            site to the user, and may trigger a positive emotional response 
            upon seeing an offer, which can encourage a purchase.<br><br>

            The promotional offers' bold text is eye catching but without being too
            protuding to the user, thus it avoids distracting them from the site's main content.<br>
            
            The nav-bar is small but catches the eye as it sits within the 
            legend of the hero-image. The form <br>includes transparency
            on a grey box to keep the user from visual overload.<br><br>


                <strong>The Theme<br></strong>
                Rye font represents a more outlandish style, which focuses on the “outlaw” theme. This is to subconsciously tell<br> the viewer that we are not corporate dominators but outlanders. The star represents law.<br><br>


                <strong>Main Heading<br></strong>
                
                The name 'Raidr Mods' was originally of viking origin, inspired
                by a fantasy game: The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, which is predominantly viking themed.<br>

                Skyrim has the most popular modding community and subconsciously tells the viewer that we have Skyrim mods without their conscious knowledge.<br><br>


                <strong>Navbar<br></strong>
                The navbar is close to the center of the hero image and its individual nav links are spaced closely together, to emphasize a cleaner aesthetic. This was <br>achieved by keeping the width of the navbar at least half the size of the main header, but also in sacrifice of spacing the navbar links, while also maintaining a large enough size for a navbar.<br><br>

                <strong>Hero-Image<br></strong>
                I have chosen a Read Dead Redemption 2 image to subconsciously show the viewer that this is a
                high quality website - analogous to the game, which achieved 
                Game of The Year and Game of The Decade awards. This can also <br>
                 incite a positive emotional response in the viewer, as many gamers would have played this game<br> and found it to be an emotional experience, which could provoke emotion-based purchases, or/and impulse buying.<br>
                     Most users may make a purchase on their first visit to a wesbite - by invoking an emotional repsonse, 
                     I hope to incite a similar repsponse and encourage more purchases by implementing good visual desgin.<br><br> 
                
                <strong>News<br></strong>
                The news has padding to keep the aesthetic clean, while also pushing it further into the center <br>
                for the user to see more clearly.
                It is in white with no box around it to make it uncluttered, coherent and professional, while compelling the viewer to look and take notice of it. The black represents a link, and is made clear by its contrast to the white.<br><br>

                <strong>Sign In<br></strong>
                I have used a more standard form to keep a white aesthetic, to promote the use of accounts. My plan is to remove<br> the sign-in form once the user has logged in. The register link is also in-between both username and password to convey the importance of it, by keeping it centred. Sign-In may be improved at a later date, but also may be perfect the way it is.<br><br>

                <strong>Introduction<br></strong>
                The introduction is lower on the page, trying not to force the user to read it, but also giving them a chance to<br> scroll down and find a video there. As you may be able to tell, the introduction is somewhat teasing you to scroll down and find out if there is any more content.<br><br>


        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3><strong>Register Page</strong></h3>
        <p>The register page is simple and straightforward. All focus is 
            on the form box due to the contrasting background.<br> 
            All that is required are highlighted, while "Phone Number"
            has a lower opacity to signify lower importance. <br>The form 
            border also gives the user more focus on the form. Each input 
            is silver to reduce eye strain from the page.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h3><strong>Mod Store Page</strong></h3>
        <p> The Game Mod Page consists of 3 columns and multiple rows. B2C 
            will expect a good list of mods to gain inspiration and find mods <br>
            they never knew existed in order to spike intrigue. Mods will be  
            sorted from most popular to least to improve UX. The color of the <br>
            "mod box" is a color that should keep visual overload to a minimum  
            - this includes the text size and colour; plentiful information  <br>
            with little sacrifice. Each mod has a price which the seller will 
            set. An "add to basket" icon will make purchases more seemless. <br>

        <br><br>

        <h3><strong>Game Page</strong></h3>
        <p> The "Game Page" is simple and easy to understand. The games are sorted 
            by popularity. Each game has a smaller scale when the user's cursor 
            hover's over them, to make visual presentation seem more seemless.
