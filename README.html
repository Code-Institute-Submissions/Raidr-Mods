<h1>Raidr Mods</h1>
            <hr>

    <p>This website is created with the intention of selling modifications (mods)
        to gamers. Mods are downloadable modifications for your game that would 
        traditionally be free. (<em>Example: Texture replacement of a character's shirt.</em>)
    
        The goal for this website is to implement a system were mod creators can make
        a profit, but must conform to a contract that requires a deadline and a bug-free 
        product. Currently, B2C will not be willing to make a purchase because 
        selling mods has been frowned upon for a long duration of time. There should be a 
        video within the Home-Page explaining how this benefits the consumer. <br>
        <br><br><br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<br><br>

        <!--May add Sign-Up modal-->

    <h3><strong>Home Page</strong></h3>
        <p>The homepage is simple so it puts focus onto the 
            promotional video in order to reconcile consumers 
            and paid mods.<br> While also having promotional offers
            among the hero-image that aren't too "in-your-face"
            but also catches the eye <br>with bold text. The nav-bar 
            is small but catches the eye as it sits within the 
            legend of the hero-image. The form <br>includes transparency
            on a grey box to keep the user from visual overload.

        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3><strong>Register Page</strong></h3>
        <p>Register page is simple and straightforward. All focus is 
            on the form box due to the contrasting background.<br> 
            All that is required are highlighted, while "Phone Number"
            has a lower opacity to signify lower importance. <br>The form 
            border also gives the user more focus on the form. Each input 
            is silver to reduce eye strain from the page.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h3><strong>Mod Store Page</strong></h3>
        <p> The Game Mod Page consists of 3 columns and multiple rows. B2C 
            will expect a good list of mods to gain inspiration and find mods <br>
            they never knew existed; In order to spike intrigue. Mods will be  
            sorted from most popular to least, to improve UX. The color of the <br>
            "mod box" is a color that should keep visual overload to a minimum  
            this also includes the text size and colour; Plentiful information  <br>
            with little sacrifice. Each mod has a price which the seller will 
            set, and a "add to basket" logo to make purchases more seemless. <br>
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h3><strong>Game Page </strong></h3>
        <p> The "Game Page" is simple and easy to understand. The games are sorted 
            by popularity. Each game has a smaller scale when the user's cursor 
            hover's over them, to make visual presentation seem more seemless.
        </p>
